# ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator

!syntax description /MeshGenerators/ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator

## Description

The `ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator` object is to generate meshes for concentric circles. Particularly, it would be useful to generate 2D meshes for typical LWR fuels. Users can refine meshes by providing a higher number of rings for each specified concentric circle region or a higher number of sectors in each quadrant.

!alert note
Be aware: `ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator` only works with the ReplicatedMesh type.

### More Information

`ConcentricCircleMeshGenerator` works by creating the first quadrant called "top_right." MooseEnum called portion controls which portion of meshes is generated. Any other one-fourth portions of circles are generated by rotating the "top_right" portion. Half portions are generated by stitching two different one-fourth portions depending on users' usages.

Users must provide the input parameters such as a number of sectors in a quadrant, a list of radii, a list of rings, the inner mesh fraction, a boolean for the volume preserving function.
- list of radii: specific locations of radii of concentric circles
- list of rings: numbers of rings for concentric circles
- inner mesh fraction: ratio of the length of the inner square to the radius of the innermost circle mesh
- volume for concentric circles can be preserved or not (on/off).

Users can choose if meshes for the moderator are added to meshes for concentric circles or not. A portion can be specified, however, it is not required. The default setting generates the full concentric circles.
